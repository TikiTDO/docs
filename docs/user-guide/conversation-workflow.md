The customer initiates a conversation from the website front end - through the widget.

For example: Customer types in 'hi'

<div align="center">

<img src={require('../../static/img/howconversationhappens1.png').default} width="800" alt="Enable Developer Mode" />

</div>

Automated response set in[channel greeting message](add-inbox-settings.md) will immediately be displayed on the screen as a reply.
In addition, two more automated messages will be sent by 'bot' to collect customer's information - email id - for further communication and record.

### Campaigns

If the customer does not initiate conversation and you have enabled [Campaign message](add-inbox-settings.md), the message will be displayed on the screen just above the widget to attract customer attention.  

<div align="center">

### Pre Chat Forms

If we have enabled [Pre Chat forms](add-inbox-settings.md) in Inbox, as soon as the customer clicks on chat widget, the message requesting for name and e-mail id will appear on screen as below.
