title: "How Conversation Happens"
---
Customer initiates a conversation from the website front end - through the widget

For eg : Cusotmer types in 'hi'

<div align="center">

<img src={require('../../static/img/howconversationhappens1.png').default} width="800" alt="Enable Developer Mode" />

</div>

Automated response set in[channel greeting message](addinboxsettings.md) will immediately be displayed on the screen as a reply.
In addition two more automated messages will be sent by 'bot' to collect customer's information - email id - for further communication and record.

Now let us look at how this message is captured in the Agent Dashboard.
